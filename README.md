# 👋 Hi, I’m Lawrence Karanja

I’m a Java Engineer specializing in backend systems, secure APIs, and scalable architectures, with experience spanning hands-on development, system design, and technical evaluation.

I build production-grade software using Java and Spring Boot, with a focus on maintainability, security, and clear architectural boundaries. Alongside building systems, I’ve spent years evaluating and mentoring engineers, giving me strong judgment around code quality and production readiness.

## 🔭 Core Focus Areas
- Backend engineering with Java & Spring Boot
- Secure REST API design (JWT, RBAC, OAuth2)
- Modular and feature-first architectures
- Event-driven and microservices-ready systems
- CI/CD, containerization, and automated testing

## 🤔 Selected Work
- **[Bicycle Safety Registration System](https://github.com/lawrence254/wheelsafe)** 
  - End-to-end backend system serving law enforcement and insurers
  - Modular architecture with security, audit logging, and analytics
  - Dockerized CI/CD pipeline with automated tests and migrations

- **Sensor Collector**
  - Event-driven microservices for real-time data ingestion
  - Kafka streaming with Prometheus, Grafana, and time-series storage

- **APITracker**
  - Cross-platform desktop application for secure API key management

## 🌱 Background
- Software Engineer — Independent / Project-Based
- Technical Screener — Toptal
- Manager & Team Lead — Moringa School

## 👯 What I’m Looking For
A collaborative engineering team where I can:
- Own backend components end-to-end
- Contribute production-quality Java systems
- Apply strong architectural judgment
- Learn deeply while mentoring
